% My priority goal has always been acquiring knowledge and skill. Teamwork and creation of useful products are also very important for me as a software engineer. By now I have developed vast amount of skills related to high-performance low-level programming, including low-latency, high-bandwidth distributed inference service. I am looking forward to extending my knowledge about any part of computer science of software engineering.
